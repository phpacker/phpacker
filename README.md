# phpacker

| Platform | Architectures |
| -------- | ------------- |
| mac      | arm, x64      |
| linux    | arm, x64      |
| windows  | x64           |
| all      | -             |

```bash
# builds mac-arm only
phpacker build mac arm --src=./app.php

# builds for all available platforms/architectures
phpacker build all --src=./app.php
```

Your executables will be generated in `{src-root}/build`. You may change this behaviour using the `--dest=./custom-build-path` option.

## Customize PHP ini

You can define custom PHP ini definitions by using the `--ini` flag.

```bash
# will detect phpacker.ini in the src-root - or prompt interactively
phpacker build all --src=./app.php --ini

# alternatevely you may provide a path
phpacker build all --src=./app.php --ini=./custom-ini-path.ini
```

## Updating the PHP binaries

The `build` command will check for updates automatically. If you wish you can check for updates manually.

```bash
# update pre-built binaries
phpacker download
```

You may also update any binaries generated by a `phpacker/php-bin` compatible workflow.

```bash
# update any php-bin compatible repository
phpacker download "{org}/{user}/php-bin"
```

## Config file

**in progress**

Every arguments you can pass to the `build` command is settable in a config file. This config will automatically be used when running `build` witout any arguments.

```json
{
  "platform": "all",
  "architectures": [],
  "bin": "{org}/{user}/php-bin", # defaults to phpacker/php-bin
}
```

By default phpacker will look for a `phpacker.json` file in the same directory as the build `src` option. Alternatively you may pass a custom path to a config file.

```bash
# you can provide a config path.
# phpacker.json will always be used unless this option is given
phpacker build all --src=./app.php --config=./custom-config-path.json
```

## Custom php builds

**in progress**

PHPacker uses pre-built staticly linked PHP binaries in order to enable cross-compilation. Custom binaries need to be built on the platforms they are intended for.

We aim to make this as simple as possible by providing a GitHub Workflow that generates these binaries.

To use your own you need to:

- clone the [php-bin](https://github.com/phpacker/php-bin) repo
- update php-extensions.txt - See the [extension list](https://static-php.dev/en/guide/extensions.html) to see what's supported
- run the workflows, merge all pull requests & tag a release

To use your custom binaries you need to set the repository url. You can do this by adding it to your `phpacker.json` file in the src-root. PHPacker will pick this up automatically during the build.

```json
{
  "bin": "{org}/{user}/php-bin"
}
```

Alternatively you may pass a repo directly as a command option

```bash
# you can provide a config path.
# phpacker.json will always be used unless this option is given
phpacker build all --src=./app.php --config=./custom-config-path.json
```
